          <span>Hi there! I'm Matt.<br /><br />
            I've been programming and analyzing data since I was a teenager.<br /><br />
            As I've grown (literally and skill-wise), I've designed webapps (front-end and back-end), written scripts, gained meaningful insight out of datasets and built databases for a variety of projects.<br /><br />
            I'm passionate about all things open-source, privacy, great user experience, idiomatic code and best practices.<br /><br />
            In my free time, I like to read manga and graphic novels, watch movies, spend time with nature and play video games.<br />
          </span>
